# XX Analytics Dashboard

## Data Engineer ZoomCamp 

This repository contains my learning journey and work from the [Data Engineer ZoomCamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp).

## **Problem Statement**

Develop a dashboard with two tiles by:

* Selecting a dataset of interest (see [Datasets](#datasets))
* Creating a pipeline for processing this dataset and putting it to a datalake
* Creating a pipeline for moving the data from the lake to a data warehouse
* Transforming the data in the data warehouse: prepare it for the dashboard
* Building a dashboard to visualize the data
